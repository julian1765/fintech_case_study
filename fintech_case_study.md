# FinTech Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
  Wealthfront

* When was the company incorporated?
  2008

* Who are the founders of the company?
  Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  The company came about when cofounder Andy Rachleff was teaching at Stanford. Multiple students and entrepreneurs kept coming up to Rachleff for investing advice. Students seeked the professor’s advice because he had started his own VC Firm called Benchmark Capital. Often times, students could not use professor Rachleff services because the minimums were too high.  

  Andy also notice a few common issues holding back very wealthy and well-known financial institutions. Many of these establishments still relied upon outdated technology and manual calculations. 

Cofounder Dan Carroll, who was a former trader, also found that the common man was not getting the financial advice that they deserve. Back in 2008, during the financial crisis, Matt was visiting his parents when he was shocked by one of their financial statement. It had appeared that their financial advisor had not been giving them the attention that they deserve. Typically, financial advisors get 90 percent of their income from 10m percent of their wealthiest clients leaving the rest of their clientele unattended.

Andy reached out to dan multiple times, but Dan did not answer because he was not too fond of Venture Capitalist firms. Andy Final got a hold of Dan and reiterated that he was very well off and was not in this to make money. He simply wanted everyone to have the same investing advice that he did. That’s when the two realized that the shared the same mission and Wealthfront was created.   
  

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The Company is currently funded by Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures, The Social+Capital Partnership. It is also funded by 3 wealthy individuals: Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and Jeff Jordan. 

To Date they have received 65.5 million.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The founders of Wealthfront realized that the normal citizen did not have access to investing advice due to high minimums. They also noticed that people were not getting the proper attention from their financial advisors. 

Wealthfront Believes that the Financial industry is not designed to be fair. When you hire experts there’s a lot of money to be made. And when you try and make the decision for yourself, you can never be sure you are making the right one. As you can see, this creates a lot of difficulty for middle class citizens to receive a fair level of financial advice. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

Wealthfront’s intended customer is the middle class to upper middle-class citizen who does not have the proper access to financial advice. They have a very low barrier to entry with a 500-dollar minimum. 

According to many analysts, there is currently around 1 trillion dollars globally that is managed by Robo advisors as of may 2019. This industry is forecasted to grow to 2.2 trillion by the end of 2020. To put this into perspective, there is around 22 trillion in investable assets globally. About 9 trillion is cash sitting in a bank account.


What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Wealthfront has a couple competitive advantages when it comes to their competition. Their first advantage speaks volumes to their commitment to helping middle class. Wealthfront charges fees when you have exceeded 5000 dollars in assets. Competitors such as Ellevest and betterment offer 2 months to a year free. 

Along with having your fees waived, if users decide not to have your money managed by Wealthfront, you can link your bank and retirement account to its financial planning tool called path. This gives you complete visibility through one application without having any charges. 

Where Wealthfront really starts to separate from the pack is behind their investment strategy. They have incorporated a streamlined questionnaire that gives users the ability to rate their risk tolerance and allows exchange-trade funds in ll different asset trade classes.

Wealthfront also offers a proprietary mutual fund for accounts that exceed 100,000 called Wealthfront Risk Parity Fund. This account offers more showing to asset classes with higher risk adjusted returns.

In conclusion, what Wealthfront can offer that the competition lacks is their ability to have the lowest cost of all competitors. There is also very little commitment to the application, so users do not feel trapped or baited into using Wealthfront.  




## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Robo Advisor

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Since the inception of Robo Advisors around 2008, the landscape is almost indistinguishable. One major trend that some Robo advisors have adopted is acknowledging and catering to users of the Islamic faith. There are currently 3.45 million Muslim U.S. citizens in 2017. In the Islamic faith, there is a law called Sharia law which forbids earning interest from a borrower or lender. Sharia also forbids investing in companies that are deemed harmful such as alcohol, weapons and tobacco. Wahed invest and Wealthsimple are Robo advisors based out of New York that have incorporated a halal S&P index for safe investing.

Another major innovation that has taken place in this domain has been offering loans to users. As stated before, wealthfront and a handful of other robo advising companies offer loans to existing clients. Wealthfront will give you a line of credit up to 30 percent of what the portfolio is valued at. Wealthfront users must have at least 30,000 to access this loan. This loan can be granted without a credit check, filling out an application, or paying fees. Interest rates can vary between 3 and 5 percent.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

 The industry that has been affected most by Robo Advisors is Financial Advisors and Financial Planners. Many professional in this career path believe that they will lose their jobs to algorithms. As stated before, there were many middle class people who felt that financial advisors either did not care enough about them because of how much business they were getting or they were being over charged by their financial advisor because they simply didn’t know better. Investors also agree that these services should be offered to the masses at a cheaper rate. Most human financial advisors charged 1 percent while Robo Advisors charge .25 percent per year. 

The Robo Advisor domain is also catering more towards the millennial generation that has more trust in technology than older generations. As a millennial, we are used to web based application automating old practices. This is something that we have grown up with and got accustomed too. As for the older generation, they prefer the human interaction that gives them more of a sense of security. With a traditional Financial Advisor, you would have to schedule a face to face meeting and carve out time in your schedule. You would also have to do deal with sales tactics that may push for additional services that they do not see fit. These sales tactics and long client meeting have been automated by a questionnaire that asks what the clients financial plans a wealth goals are. This can all be done from the comfort of a cell phone or laptop. Theres, no meeting, scheduling, phone calls that usually take up a lot of a person’s time. One of the biggest reason’s why the millennial market is so important is because they are the largest generation in the U.S. and currently have an estimated 7 trillion in liquid assets.

Another aspect of Robo Technology that will affect financial advisors is the long-term sustainability of technology as it relates to finance. Most if not all Robo Advising companies use platforms with algorithms for investing. This means that Robo companies do not need to employ large work forces to manage accounts. This cuts down operating costs an allowed betterment to charge users .15 percent.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Measuring success for Robo Advisors typically entails rating multiple heavily weighted categories including account minimums, customer support, trading costs, investment selection, user facing technologies, branch access and account fees. For most, the important metric is the return on investment. Yes, it is important that your money is safe and that it grows. You can look at a company’s growth performance from the prior years. The problem with this is that just because you had a stellar performance in years past, does not mean you can replicate that same level of success in the future. 

Based upon these metrics, Nerdwallet one of the most trusted critics gave them 5 stars. They have extremely competitive management fees, taxable accounts, free financial tools, and college plans.  


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Wealthfront currently sits at third when it comes to assets under management with 12 billion. In terms of assets under management, Wealthfront is doing a pretty good job compared to their competitors. However, Wealthfront does need to improve when it comes to a profitability standpoint. Since they only charge .25 management fee on 12 billion in assets, their revenue for the year sits at 33 million. Keep in mind that this 33 million must also cover over 100 employees and operating costs.  


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!) 

The biggest criticism for Wealthfront is their lack of human advisor options. Wealthfront currently does not have any options for human interaction other than a customer service line which most people tend to avoid. sometimes your biggest strength can also be your biggest weakness and that seems to be the case for Wealthfront. While users do enjoy the automation of Wealthfront’s platform they do lack human contact when it is necessary. For instance, betterment offers unlimited phone calls with a team of certified financial planners. This is only offered to users who enroll in betterment premium, but this is nice to know that the option is there if the user feels it is necessary. 

What I would advise Wealthfront to do is have a couple different options. The first option would be to have an iteraction with a human advisor via instant chat that would be available on their mobile application or web portal. The second recommendation, would be similar to what betterment has put in place where premium members can access virtual chats with financial planners.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This offering would help the company because it helps increase membership of an older demographic. As stated before, people who are older are more hesitant to go 100 percent in on Robo Advising with no human advisory connection. If this offering is put in place, this gives the older generation the human interaction it seeks, while taking advantage of the advanced technology and automation that Robo Advising provides. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Wealthfront would benefit from investment platform customization. Wealthfront currently lacks the ability for advanced investors to fine-tune and customize their portfolio. This technology would allow investors to delete individual stocks and replace them.

What would also be beneficial would be a reporting feature that can keeps track of bought and sold stocks as well as watchlists to have all data in one application.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
 
These technologies are appropriate because they target a current segment of the market share that Wealthfront currently does not have much market share in.
